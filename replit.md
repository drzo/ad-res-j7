## Running the Project

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test                  # Run all 128 tests (validation + integration)
npm run test:validation   # Run workflow structure tests only
npm run test:integration  # Run functional tests only
npm run test:simple       # Run simple workflow tests
```

### Current Status

- **Test Coverage:** 
  - 85 validation tests (workflow structure and syntax)
  - 43 integration tests (functional behavior)

## Automated Workflows

The project validates two main GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **todo-to-issues** - Automatically creates GitHub issues from tasks in the `todo/` folder
2. **file-representations** - Maintains JSON and Markdown file format synchronization
